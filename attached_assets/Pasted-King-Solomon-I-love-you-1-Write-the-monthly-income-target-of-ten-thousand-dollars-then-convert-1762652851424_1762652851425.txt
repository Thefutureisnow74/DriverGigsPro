1. Write the monthly income target of ten thousand dollars, then convert it to two thousand five hundred dollars per week and five hundred dollars per day.
2. Define the daily volume plan of ten deliveries at an average of fifty dollars to reach five hundred dollars per day.
3. Select one anchor service that pays a steady weekly base, then commit to stacking on-demand deliveries around that base each day.
4. Build three lists: companies with contract routes, on-demand delivery applications, and private local businesses that ship daily.
5. Contact companies that post independent and master contractor routes and ask for multiple routes, not only one.
6. Negotiate weekly route pay and request performance add-ons for on-time percentage, scan accuracy, and proof-of-delivery quality.
7. Create a margin model that allows subcontracting: accept a route at one thousand five hundred dollars per week, pay a driver one thousand two hundred dollars, and keep three hundred dollars.
8. Duplicate the margin model across several routes so that three identical routes produce nine hundred dollars per week in company margin.
9. Use a package model for large e-commerce: request at least three dollars for each package, pay drivers two dollars and fifty cents for each package, and retain fifty cents for each package.
10. Scale the package model by assigning ten one-hundred-package routes to earn five hundred dollars in company margin each day without driving.
11. Post hiring advertisements on large job boards and community boards that highlight one hundred packages per day, fast routes, and prior experience with national parcel carriers.
12. Target experienced parcel drivers who already complete two hundred to three hundred packages per day and will easily finish one hundred packages within eight hours.
13. Offer clear daily pay, start times, geographic zones, and required vehicle types in every advertisement to speed up recruiting.
14. Build a rapid screening flow: phone interview, document collection, insurance verification, short road test, and start date within one week.
15. Maintain a bench list of standby drivers in every city where you hold a contract so a route never goes uncovered.
16. Run a daily stacking plan: anchor route first, then fill gaps with on-demand pickups within a ten-mile radius during idle windows.
17. Use three daily metrics to steer decisions: dollars for each hour, dollars for each mile, and idle minutes; drop any task that weakens the average.
18. Track a weekly scoreboard: total completed stops, average revenue for each stop, company margin for each stop, and route on-time percentage.
19. Build direct relationships with pharmacies, laboratories, clinics, auto parts suppliers, caterers, and law firms for repeat weekday work.
20. Create a simple one-page rate sheet that lists zone-based pricing, wait-time fees, after-hours fees, and bulk stop discounts.
21. Protect quality with a proof-of-delivery checklist: time-stamped photos, names, signatures when required, and delivery notes on every stop.
22. Standardize driver expectations in a handbook that covers uniforms, phone etiquette, safety rules, equipment, scanning, and return-to-station procedures.
23. Assign each route to a named driver and a named backup, with a written swap process for illness, vehicle failure, and weather delays.
24. Review route density weekly and redesign sequences to reduce left turns, deadhead miles, and long cross-town jumps.
25. Raise rates or replace clients that fall below your target dollars for each hour and dollars for each mile for two consecutive weeks.
26. Expand geographically by listing second-tier and third-tier cities with high shipping growth and less competition, then test with temporary drivers before committing to long contracts.
27. Build a simple financial rhythm: separate daily fuel, weekly payroll, weekly owner pay, monthly insurance, monthly maintenance, quarterly taxes, and growth reserves.
28. Reinvest the first three months of company margin into recruiting, spare vehicles, and evening routes so the anchor revenue never depends on you personally.
29. Add a dispatcher role once you reach five active routes so that driver support, customer updates, and exception handling are covered in real time.
30. Repeat the cycle of win a route, assign a driver, protect the margin, measure performance, and add one more route until the weekly company margin alone meets or exceeds two thousand five hundred dollars.
